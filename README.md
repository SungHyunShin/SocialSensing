# How to run code
I have three different files: one for each exercise. They are labeled Exercise1.py, Exercise2.py, and Exercise3.py.
To run these files simply run `python Exercise1.py`, `python Exercise2.py`, and `python Exercise3.py`.

# Python version
I used python 3.5.2 to run this code.

# Classifying Obamacare Tweets
We took 600 random tweets from `NewObamacare.csv` and placed them in the file, `NewClassifyObamacare.csv`. From there
we manually went through each of these tweets and add a column to the end of each of the lines for whether they were
against the idea of Obamacare (-1), for the idea of Obamacare (1), or neutral towards the idea (0). For these tweets,
we also deleted any tweet not in English because this would mess with the sentiment analysis tool. Furthermore, we 
will go about removing non-English tweets while analyzing them.
